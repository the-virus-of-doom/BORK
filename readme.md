# BORK

Gabe the Dog was left at home while his owner was running errands. Unfortunately, his owner locked up Gabe's favorite toy: the magic ball. Gabe saw his owner lock it in the chest in his bedroom, but needs to find the spare key in the basement. Help Gabe find his ball so he can 'Bork' playfully again!

## Original

The following was originally in the `main.cpp` file (as was everything else). The only changes made have been to redact personal information from the project and to move the `readme` and `todo` out of `main.cpp`. Additionally, some minor formatting changes have been put in place for markdown as these were originally plain text notes. Besides what has been mentioned, this project is unchanged from when it was submitted in 2019.

### Project Title

Bork: Gabe the Dog and the Magic Ball

### Description

This program is based off of Zork and has the player control Gabe the Dog (a famous internet dog known for his "bork") to find his "magic ball" that his owner locked up for some terrible reason. The player must then search around the house for items to help Gabe find the spare key to unlock the chest the ball is hidden in. Can you help Gabe before his owner comes home?

### Developer comments

virus:
I wrote this entire game from scratch with only some minor scope related debugging from [my instructor]. Overall, I learned quite a bit from this assignment as I had to break the game down into several different sections and start from the bottom up. I think it was really interesting to start from the very beginning with first defining the structures and classes with some basic datastructures and then building on top of each successive layer of complexity to reach higher levels of function. Seeing this develop was really cool to watch as it really taught me how to both debug and make sure that each part was working properly before I could move on. I am honestly really proud of how this program turned out and how it allowed me to demonstrate what I have learned. The fact that I wrote every single line of code for this is something that I really like. Due to my weird work schedule I decided to work on this project on my own and not have a partner. While this is not the best, it still allowed for me to make sure that I actually knew what I was doing for this project.

## Addendum 2022-05-30

Oh boy. This was my first "major" project that I completed for my first official programming class my freshman year of college. Looking at old git commits, I put in my last commit 3 years ago on 2019-03-15 at 11:56 pm. Since then, I've changed majors, spent several years working at my university's VR center, endured Covid-19's effect on the world, and now I even have a full time junior developer job. Time really does fly.

### Build instructions

I originally made this using Qt Creator since that was what the class used, but have since moved on to using VS and VS Code. Since this is such a simple project (everything is in one file, for better or worse), you can use your favorite C++ compiler to build the executable file.
